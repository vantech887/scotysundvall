      <p>I began writing lyrics five years ago, since then I started up the Christian Slamcore band Legion of Adonai. As of right now, I have thirty song lyrics under my belt. Which includes the band's EP Apocalyptic Revelator, the full length album Debaucherous Debasement, and six singles Hope, Ablazed, Cruel Diseasevital Medicine, The Servant King, Cult of Orifices, Crimson Apparition, and Sluts of the Sanctimonious. In my five years as a Lyricist, I've been blessed to have worked with bands, such as Diamonds to Dust, Enoch, Searching Serenity, Dehumanize, Voluntary Mortifcation, His Kingdom Suffers, and Scapegoat. I need to put specific attention on the band Scapegoat. I've had the privilege to contribute four song lyrics to their debut EP For the Broken and the Fallen. I wrote the tracks Toxoplasmosis, Rhiannon, Seductress of The Bridal Selection, Depopulate for Sustainability, and Melancholic Entrenchment.</p>
